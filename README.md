# ToDo-List

This is the first app I developed on my learning React journey. Along the way, I used Expo and my mobile phone to follow the live changes of the code.
The design is pretty intuitive. You write the tasks you want to accomplish and click on the "+" button. 
After finishing one task, you click on it and it will be deleted. The logo is my humble attempt to design new UI components. 

What I have learned from this project:
- setting up the environment
- what is a functional component
- using the State Hook
- how props work


Below I attached 2 screenshots of the project:
